# Chapter 9
## Transition Architectures

Having a picture of where you've been, along with where you'd like to be, is fantastic...however, having a plan to get from where you are to where you'd like to be is even better.  That's where transition architectures come into play.  To prepare for your future state you will likely have to establish some groundwork before full-scale deployments to the cloud can occur.  In this chapter, there are several aspects that are focused on regarding that groundwork.  Things such as Azure Policy, role-based access control (RBAC), and dev/test environments are just a few items that can be helpful in transitioning to a fully cloud-based workload.  Having transition plans for all architecture domains is important, though--be sure to be thorough in analyzing the needs for each domain prior to attempting any workload migration.  Keep in mind that transition architectures can be transient in nature--they may be throwaway designs or components that help bridge a gap until you are ready to fully deploy your workload to the target state.
