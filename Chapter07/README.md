## Performance Considerations

One area of application development that may tend to take a backseat when deadlines are looming is that of performance management.  While there are many application performance management (APM) tools on the market, having a keen understanding of common bottlenecks in application code as well as platform composition can help make performance a first-class citizen.  Equally as important is knowledge of cloud-based limitations and features that can impact how well an application will perform given various factors, including location, bandwidth, throughput, and more.  Being able to test for performance bottlenecks, and automating that process, can help bring performance management into the pipeline.
