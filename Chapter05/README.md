# Chapter 5
## The Wireframe

Once you have a good idea of what you're working with, you can take that and build forward a vision of what you'd like to accomplish during the migration, replatforming, or net new build out.  Part of that understanding will come in the form of analysis sessions to make sure that the design you put together satisfies the needs of the business.  Cataloging these sessions in the form of an assessment helps to preserve the information for people who may join the team later, or just want an understanding of how decisions were made.
