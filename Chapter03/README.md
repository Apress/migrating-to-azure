# Chapter 3
## Security and Compliance

The security questionnaire referenced in this chapter is derived from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication [800-171](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r1.pdf), which outlines questions around several categories of technology security.  The International Standards Organization (ISO) also tracks a wide variety of information related to information security roles, responsibilities, controls, project plans, and audit procedures.  Aligning with these two models will prove useful as many industry specific capabilities can also be demonstrated by satisfying the ISO 27001/270018 controls.
