# Chapter 12
## Operations and Site Reliability

Bringing it all to closure, the last chapter follows up on the work done in chapter 4 related to operating models.  Having defined roles for all aspects of the organization will be of tantamount importance moving forward as not everyone will understand where they fit into place.  Two areas that require attention are those of operations and site reliability.  By Google's [definition](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor/), site reliability straddles the line between development and operations, keeping the lights on and helping to detect, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues that come up as a result of application execution.  Operations itself also blends into the site reliability area, but also focuses on the business aspect of operating the application or platform.
