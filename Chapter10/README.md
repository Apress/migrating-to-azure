# Chapter 10
## Development Concepts

Many of the fundamentals of software development will span on-premises and cloud environments.  Some fundamentals will shift, however, and being ready to help development teams accommodate that shift is extremely important.  One way to help teams get used to the inevitable shift in mindset and tooling is to bootstrap environments for developers, removing friction and ensuring consistency between team members as well as teams.  As individual developers (and teams, for that matter) may have different preferences on how to format files, what editor(s) to use, and so on, having a common way to set up those tools for developers can help simplify onboarding for new team members and help catalog what is being used in the development pipeline.
