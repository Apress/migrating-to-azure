    Specify the full domain name(s) of Active Directory. Jenkins uses this information to locate the LDAP service
    and performs authentication. If you wish to attempt authentication against multiple Active Directory domains 
    the entries can be separated by a comma.

    <p>
    If you specify the forest name (say <tt>contoso.com</tt> instead of <tt>europe.contoso.com</tt>),
    then the search will be done against the global catalog. If you do this without specifying
    the bind DN, the user would have to login as "europe\joe" or "joe@europe".
