  <p>
    If this option is enabled, the build archive within the build results will also be backed up. Even more data!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have specific files not normally backed up, that you also want to back up, entering a regex here which identifies those files will include them. All files with a name matching this regular expression will be backed up. If the expression is invalid, it will be disregarded.
    <br/>
    Note that this only allows filename patterns, (not full ant-style patterns) but positive and negative look-aheads are effective at filtering out the primary folder. 
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b><br/>
    <i>^(email\-templates|.*\.jelly)$</i> will include email-templates/*.jelly .
    <br/>
    <i>^(?!jobs)(?!plugins)(?!logs)(?!users)(log|.*\.xml)$</i> will include *.xml and log/*.xml while skipping the jobs, logs, users and plugins folders under the home folder.
  </p>
