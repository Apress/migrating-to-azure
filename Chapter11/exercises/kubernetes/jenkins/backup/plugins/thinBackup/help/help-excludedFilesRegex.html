  <p>
    If you have specific files you do not want to back up, entering a regex here which identifies those files will prevent them being backed up. All files with a name matching this regular expression will not be backed up. Leave empty if not needed. If the expression is invalid, it will be disregarded.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Example:</b><br/>
    <i>^.*\.(log)$</i> will exclude all files ending with the extension <i>.log</i>.
