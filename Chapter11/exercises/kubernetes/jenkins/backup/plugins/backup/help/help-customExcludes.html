<div>
    Comma- or space-separated list of file/directory names to exclude from backup.  These
    apply across the entire backup.<br/>
    For example, setting this field to <code>war,plugins</code> will
    allow you to avoid backing up "binaries" that you don't want to back up.  But, this will
    also exclude any file/directory named "war" or "plugins" anywhere in Hudson's home directory.
    <br/>
    If no value is specified, the whole content of the Hudson home directory will be taken
    into account.
