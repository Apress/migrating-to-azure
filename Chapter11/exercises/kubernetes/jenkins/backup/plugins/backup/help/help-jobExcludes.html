<div>
    Optionally specify the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">
    'excludes' pattern</a> to restrict what has been specified in the Includes
    field. That is, a file that matches both this mask and the Includes one will
    not be saved. The base directory is the workspace of each job.<br/>
    For example, setting this field to <code>src/repository/*</code> and the
    Includes field to <code>src/**</code> will allow saving, for each job, the
    whole content of the <code>src</code> directory, excluding the <code>
    src/repository</code> one.
