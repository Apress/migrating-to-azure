    Pick up the archive format to be used.<br/>
    Notice that only ZIP files can be used on Windows environments. As such,
    this introduces several limitations, such as the archive size (4GB), the
    number of files in the archive (65535), etc. See
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29">this entry</a>
    on Wikipedia for more information.
