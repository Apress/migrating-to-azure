<div>
    Comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files/directories to be saved.
    See the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">
    @includes of Ant fileset</a> for the exact format. The base directory is the
    workspace of each job.<br/>
    For example, setting this field to <code>src/**</code> will allow saving, for
    each job, the whole content of its <code>src</code> directory, excluding any
    other files/directories in the workspace.<br/>
    If no value is specified, the whole content of the workspaces will be taken
    into account.
