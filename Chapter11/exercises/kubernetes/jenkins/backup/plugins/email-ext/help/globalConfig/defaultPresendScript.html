	This script will be run prior to sending the email to allow 
	modifying the email before sending. The MimeMessage variable
	is "msg," the build is available as "build", a logger
	is available as "logger". The trigger that caused the email
        is available as "trigger" and all triggered builds are available
        as a map "triggered."
	<br/><br/>
	You may also cancel sending the email by setting the boolean
	variable "cancel" to true.
        <br/><br/>
        You can set the default pre-send script here and then use 
        ${DEFAULT_PRESEND_SCRIPT} in the project settings to use
        the script written here.
