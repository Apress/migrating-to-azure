# Chapter 2
## Domain Architectures
Collecting infomation about the various architecture domains is the logical next step after gaining an understanding of the business drivers behind the platform you're looking to migrate.  While it may not be necessary to have every level of detail for every domain, having knowledge of the various intersections between these domains will serve you well in later migration steps.  Sometimes the overwhelming nature of all domain information can cause you to be distracted from the task at hand--knowing what information is critical to the platform and the migration comes with time and experience.  

There are many ways to catalog and analyze the different domains themselves.  One method is to use a maturity matrix to capture the various components that comprise a platform, as well as their relative maturity from an organizational perspective.  Some may go a bit further and capture baseline maturity and augment that with periodic updates as the platform evolves.  Another method is to capture the baseline informaiton using a modeling language (as discussed in chapter 1).  The same type of approach can be taken with modeling as with the maturity matrix, capturing periodic updates to the model to help show progression over time.
