## Capacity Planning

Planning for capacity with respect to an application or entire platform can take many forms.  Tradtional infrastructure planning, while typically targeted at on-premises servers and hypervisors, is equally as important when planning for cloud compute.  The implementation of that planning may be different, but the methods by which you get the results are similar.  A common misconception is that more traditional IT jobs will be phased out and not backfilled once a cloud migration occurs.  As a part of an organization's overall management strategy, it should account for employeees repurposing their skills to work in this new world.  Capacity planning is still a huge part of the platform design process, regardless of where that platform is located.
